For Holberton School
Cohort 16.

### Introduction
##The Project

one of the many reasons why children do not want to study is due to learning difficulties.  and that is where kidfuns comes in.
Not all children learn in the same way, this situations could create to the children low self-esteem and frustration.

KIDFUNS	It is a learning alternative for children that can be monitored by the tutor.

The app can be used during classes or from home, for this the application has several exercises that help the child's learning, 
The child can unlock several levels or choose a specific theme (mathematics and language) In addition to being configured and monitored by their tutor to see their progress, and evolution with repeated times, scores, and growth charts of the child or children registered of a user.

The project does not intend to replace a teacher, on the contrary, it seeks to be a tool for the child's learning, which requires the accompaniment of a tutor.

### Architecture

For the architecture of this project, the following distribution of technologies will be carried out to display the web page. The django Rest Framework will be used to perform the functional and react requirements for the views, which will simplify the management of the backend with django, making each part of the project take care of itself, and MYSQL will be used as a database to store all the information
